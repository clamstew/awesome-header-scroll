Awesome Header Scroll
=====================
---

Based on sites like the current homepage of (flowdock.com)[http://www.flowdock.com] and similarly the way the Google Search app acts on iOS, this small js snippet aims to help you grab the header on you HTML page and only show the header when the user has scrolled past 600px, and only when the user scrolls up.  

It uses `.animate` in jQuery to make the whole script slide off screen.
